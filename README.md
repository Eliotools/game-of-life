# Game of Life

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
For more information about Conway's Game of Life, visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Features

➡️ Interactive grid where cells can be toggled by clicking
➡️ Click and drag to toggle multiple cells
➡️ Controls:
    ⮕ Next Step: Manually advance to the next generation
    ⮕ Play (1x): Run the simulation at normal speed
    ⮕ Play (20x): Run the simulation at fast speed
    ⮕ Stop: Pause the simulation
    ⮕ Reset: Clear all cells
    ⮕ Random: Randomly populate cells

## Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)

## Implementation Details

➡️ 100x100 grid (10,000 cells)
➡️ Uses CSS Grid for layout
➡️ Optimized cell state calculations
➡️ Responsive design with sticky controls

## How to Use

1. Open `main.html` in a web browser
2. Click cells to toggle their state
3. Use the control buttons at the bottom to:
    ⮕ Step through generations
    ⮕ Start/stop automatic simulation
    ⮕ Reset the grid
    ⮕ Generate random patterns

## Enjoy!

Feel free to experiment with different patterns and speeds. Some interesting patterns to try:
➡️ Create a "glider" that moves diagonally across the grid
➡️ Build a "blinker" that oscillates between two states
➡️ Design a "block" that remains stable
➡️ Make a "beacon" that alternates between two forms

The Game of Life is a fascinating example of how simple rules can create complex behaviors. Have fun exploring the endless possibilities!
